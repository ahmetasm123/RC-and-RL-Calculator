"""Core computational utilities for the RC and RL calculator.

This package contains the pure numerical routines used by different
front‑ends.  Functions here implement the electrical calculations for series
RL and RC circuits and deliberately avoid any user‑interface concerns.

# The public API is exposed via ``rc_rl_calculator.core.calculations``.
